                            <dt>What is Git?</dt>
                                <dd>Git is a VCS(Version control system)that is used to store and share files in repositories.  Git is also know as a 'distributed revision control system' which means it focuses on speed and keeping the integrity of the data intact.</dd>
                            <dt>Who started Git></dt>
                                <dd> The credit for creation of Git is gifted to 'Linus Korvalds', which he created in 2005, but since that year 'Junio Hamano has been maintaining it.</dd>
                            <dt>What is Hub?</dt>
                                <dd>When concerning the word 'Hub' there doesn't seem to be any information on it regarding it's relation to Github and Git.  I would assume that Hub is a network hub, the central server in Github.</dd>
                            <dt>What is the 'Repository' and what is its role?</dt>
                                <dd>A repository is a collection of files.  Like the WINSCP application, Github holds files and broadcasts them from a central server.  You can create, edit or delete files in a repository, the part about Github that is so good is that it is a Version Control System, and you can create repositories through the command line, assuming you know the commands.</dd>
                            <dt>What do you think about Github?</dt>
                                <dd>I think github is really cool.  It will be very useful in the future.</dd>
